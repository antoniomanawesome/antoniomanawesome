- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @antoniomanawesome, 4th year EE student trying to branch out to coding outside of embedded applications.
- I hope to learn DSA and create unique coding projects, along with embedded projects (with a focus on RTL/HDL)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in FPGAs, microcontrollers, and coding (analog circuits too but not as much as the former)
- ðŸŒ± My current projects are to make a chess engine in C++ and a digital saxophone with an ESP32
